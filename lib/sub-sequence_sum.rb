# Given an array of integers and a target number, find if there exist a sequence of numbers that sum up to the target.
#
# For example:
#
# array, target -> expected return:
# [10,3,1,7],	8 ->	should return true (because 1+7 = 8)
# [10,3,1,7],	10 ->	should return true (because 10 is in the array)
# [10,3,1,7],	21 ->	should return true (because the sum of the whole array return 21)
# [10,3,1,7],	22 ->	should return false (because you can't reach 22 by summing all numbers)
# [10,3,1,7],	17 ->	should return false (because 10 and 7 are not next to each other)
